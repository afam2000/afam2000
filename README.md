Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently a 4th year computer science major.

I started programming with Visual Basic in my junior year of high school (2016-2017) but have not used it since. Java is the language I'm most comfortable with, I started learning it in my senior year of highschool (2017-2018) and have used it throughout University. I've done a lot of university assignments using C++, with the occasional HTML/CSS, or C# assignments.
